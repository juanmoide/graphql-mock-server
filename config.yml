      This is an example of a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) mock server using [Serverless function from Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/introduction) and [faker](https://github.com/Marak/Faker.js) for autogenerated fake data.
      [DociQL](https://github.com/wayfair/dociql) is used to generate the documentation for this API.
      You can use the official [Playground](https://graphql-mock-server.juanmoide.vercel.app/api/graphql) or check out the [repository](https://github.com/juanmoide/graphql-vercel-mock-server).
